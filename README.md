## TrueContext

TrueContext is a document-based Question Answering system built using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm. The system allows users to upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and ask questions that are answered strictly using the uploaded content.

The project is designed as a learning-focused, end-to-end implementation of modern RAG systems, emphasizing:
- Proper document ingestion and semantic chunking
- Vector-based semantic retrieval using FAISS
- Embedding-based similarity search
- Grounded answer generation with hallucination control
- Clean engineering practices (modular code, Git discipline, Dockerized setup)

TrueContext prioritizes correctness and transparency over fluent but unreliable responses, making it suitable for educational and research use cases.
